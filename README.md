Movie Recommendation System: 
Developed a content-based movie recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences. 
Engineered combined textual features (genre, director, cast) and applied TF-IDF vectorization to extract meaningful patterns from movie descriptions. 
Utilized cosine similarity to identify and recommend the top 5 most similar movies based on user input. 
Implemented the backend using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, and handled data processing with Pandas. 
Designed a simple, responsive front-end interface using HTML and CSS to display recommended  movies.
